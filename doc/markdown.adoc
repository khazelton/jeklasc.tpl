== Lists

Unordered

* Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
* Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
 ** Marker character change forces new list start:
  *** Ac tristique libero volutpat at
  *** Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
  *** Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
* Very easy!

Ordered

. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
. Consectetur adipiscing elit
. Integer molestie lorem at massa
. You can use sequential numbers...
. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

. foo
. bar

== Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

 // Some comments
 line 1 of code
 line 2 of code
 line 3 of code

Block code "fences"
